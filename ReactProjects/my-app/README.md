Personal Project

Overview: I am building a custom website to allow customers to graph, cross reference, and compare the physical characteristics of plastic materials to aid in design and selection for the manufacting and assembly operations. 

Notes: Back-end has not been implemented yet. Still working on basic front-end looks and design. Hope to finish first working version and release by end of this year.
